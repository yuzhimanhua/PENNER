# PENNER: Pattern-enhanced Nested Named Entity Recognition in Biomedical Literature

This is the implementation of [PENNER: Pattern-enhanced Nested Named Entity Recognition in Biomedical Literature](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621485), published in BIBM 2018. The general goal of this project is to extract nested structures/patterns from a corpus.

## Quick Start
To reproduce the results in our paper, you can directly download our preprocessed data/corpus **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fGUZ_OI_iAlmpsdi1O1Dq3HvTavAu-NJ/view?usp=sharing)**, unzip the folder ```penner/``` and put it under the ```./data/``` folder. Then run
```
python3 ./src/SetExpan/set_expan_main.py
```
The expanded nested patterns will be in the output file ```./src/SetExpan/ExpanResult.txt```.

To test the method on your own dataset, you need to follow the steps listed below.

## Requirements
Adapted from [SetExpan](https://github.com/mickeystroller/SetExpan), the data preprocessing code requires the user to download the following two related packages and put them in the ```/src/tools/``` folder:

* [AutoPhrase](https://github.com/shangjingbo1226/AutoPhrase): used to extract quality phrases from raw input data.
* [Stanford CoreNLP 3.8.0](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/history.html): used to do POS tagging and select quality Noun Phrases from the previous phrase list generated by AutoPhrase. The quality Noun Phrase will be treated as the "entity".

## Input
Two input files are required in ```./data/penner/``` (You can change "penner" to your dataset name). One is the corpus with replaced type tokens and candidate meta-patterns (e.g., ```./data/penner/corpus.txt```). The other is the mapping list of pattern id and pattern surface name (e.g., ```./data/penner/pid2mp.txt```).

**To start from a raw corpus, you first need a "flat" biomedical named entity tagger (e.g., [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/)). After entity tagging, please refer to [WW-PIE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621375) (code in ```./pattern.zip```) for meta-pattern discovery.**

## Running
You can use the script
```
./run.sh
```
It contains both preprocessing steps and the main expansion algorithm.
